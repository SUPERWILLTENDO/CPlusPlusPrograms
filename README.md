**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**
This project creates a 12 hour and 24 hour clock based on user input for time. The user can also choose to add one hour, one minute, or one second. The clocks then update based on user inputs.

**What did you do particularly well?**
I think I did the display very well when creating this program, and I did check for valid inputs throughout my program which makes the user experience better.

**Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?**
I could have done better handling the loops for invalid user inputs, I have noticed that at some points the invalid entry message while print continously so I could have fixed this with a break within the loop.
Instead of having the display be "hard Coded" I could have used better formating for creating the display, this would make my code cleaner and more readable. 
I also have a lot of if statements checking for updating the hour, mintues, and seconds I could have found a more efficent way of implementing this with loops.
I could have used a case switch for the menu options and user input, this would make my code more efficent and easier to maintain and read. 
I also could have made the clock count in real time, or set it based on the users time that is on their computer, this would have made my program a lot cooler. 

**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?**
The pieces of the code that I found the most challenging to write were updating the clock settings when it reached midnight and noon when the user adds an hour. This part of the code was challenging for me to figure out because I am not used to how 24 hour clocks work, and it was a lot of trial and error when getting that right. I trial and errored my way through this problem because I find that failing through a problem is the best way to learn. The resource that I am adding to my support network is https://www.w3schools.com/. This resource is extrememly helpful when figuring out problems.

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?**
The skills that I learned in this project that will be transferable to other projects is creating clear functions. I learned alot about creating a simple user interface, as well as validating user input. These skills will help me in future projects and coursework. 

**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
I made this program maintanable, readable and adaptable by creating and calling functions for each individual task in my program. I also used simple and clear variable names which makes my code more readable and maintanable.
